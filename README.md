# Connect4-MIPS

Project for CSC 252, Computer Organization. With the final project, we were tasked to create an individualized project that used either graphics or keyboard communication. Using the MARS simulator, I was able to create the game of Connect4 with both graphics and keyboard communication. This was done by using MARS Simulator's tools, including Bitmap Display and Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator.

GAME PLAY:
1. In the MARS Simulator, open the tool "Bitmap Display" and set the diplay height and width to 512. Then "Connect to MIPS"
2. Open the tool "Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator" and "Connect to MIPS"
3. Assemble and run the code. 
4. Type "R" to go right, "L" to go left, and the space bar to place your piece (first to get 4 in a row wins)
